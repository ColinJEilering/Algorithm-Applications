# Algorithm-Applications

**Description**
This project is in cooperation with my *Algorithms Design and Analysis* Course Content at the University of Central Missouri. A purely educational, out of my own accord, and applied practice of demonstrating my knowledge of algorithmic theories and their applications.

### Reason for using Java
Java is the most fluent language for me, as well as C, yet for the sake of my schedule and timeliness I chose Java due to it's high level abstraction and OO structure.

## Goals
The following goals are my current objectives to hit with my own comprehension.

- Provide detailed definitions/descriptions for each algorithm
- Show Time Complexity(Big O/Bit Î˜ Notation) Explanations
- Practice Good Code Structure
- Practice my git skills for upcoming internships

## Future Additions
I will be adding more algorithms, as I learn throughout the semester.

**Such as:**
1. Sorting Alg.
   - Heap Sort, quicksort, counting sort, radix sort, and bucket sort.
2. Divide and Conquer Alg.
3. Greedy Alg.
4. Graph Alg.
5. Notions of class P and class NP problems

As well as the prospect of transferring all of my work in Java over to C. Finally, I will be turning some of the described algorithms into a personal project. Link will be provided below for the repo when I have a solid framework of what I plan to do.
